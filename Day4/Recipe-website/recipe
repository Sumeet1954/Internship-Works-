Recipe Title: Simple Lemon Vinaigrette

Description:
A bright and zesty homemade salad dressing that comes together in minutes. Perfect for green salads or drizzling over grilled vegetables.

Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup (120ml) extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup (60ml) fresh lemon juice (about 1 large lemon)
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- Optional: 1 small clove garlic, minced
- Optional: 1/2 teaspoon honey or maple syrup for a touch of sweetness

Instructions:
1. Juice the lemon into a small bowl or jar.
2. Add the Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, and optional garlic/sweetener to the lemon juice. Whisk to combine.
3. While whisking continuously, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the dressing emulsifies (thickens slightly and combines).
4. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (more salt, pepper, or lemon juice).
5. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Whisk again before serving as it may separate.
